    <h1>What is Ruby on Rails?</h1>
    <p>Ruby on Rails is a web development framework that allows you to build powerful and scalable web applications with ease.</p>
    <p>It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and code organization.</p>
